title: What have I learnt as a developer ?
category: Software Engineering
---

I have been working as an Application Developer for last couple of years in software industry. This journey has been amazing and has taught me lot of things. Recently, I was taking a stake of what exactly have I learnt in this industry ? How has it shaped me as a programmer and as an individual ? I am pretty certain that everyone will have her/his own personal experiences in this field. But this blog post is very specific to my learnings from different aspects of software engineering.
 
### Developer specific lessons:
- Nothing gives you more clarity than reading code. Stackoverflow / some blog posts etc are all _mohmaya_.
- Read at least one book ( Technology related ) or code of an open source project every one week or two weeks. It's cardio for your brain muscle. 
- In SW, cost of trying out something new is nuisance. So always try something new. But don't despise everything that is old.
- Reading research papers about buzz words ( e.g Hadoop, Kafka, FP etc. ) is more helpful than reading blogs which are titled "How to blah blah"  ?
- Writing tests at correct layer of pyramid is necessary. Internalize this philosophy. You won't need test coverage report on your next project to fail the build.
- If you are in 2017 and you don't know either of AI, ML, Blockchain, AR / VR. Start learning it now. Architecture and Design patterns are important but don't expect to make living out of them. The world has changed.
- Understanding core business use case of your project is very crucial. Otherwise, get ready for lots of yak shaving. Infact, you won't find meaning in anything you do if you haven't got why we are doing something on given project. If you happen to disagree with motives of project, shout out loud.
- Codify / automate solutions to every problem. Doesn't matter how big / small the problem is. Doing same thing again and again is boring and time consuming.
- There is nothing called as platform, everything is code.
- Read Hackernews, open source projects'(particularly one you are using in your current project or the one that you are really keen about) mailing lists. They are like your holy books.

### Problem solving lessons:
- If you don't have at least 2 ways to solve a problem, then you haven't understood the problem and you are thinking uni-dimensionally.
- Diversity of thoughts is very crucial. Always hear out everyone in the team. People will come up with best solutions if they are given healthy environment and safety net to fail.
- Don't crib about problems. Go and fix them by whatever way possible. This satisfaction of solving or fixing problem is eternal whereas momentary pleasures you get by cribbing about something doesn't solve anything. Same applies for dealing with people, don't indulge into small talks. If you have some concerns or differing thoughts better discuss it with that person by having open mind.
- Practice white boarding. You should be able to explain your problem on paper / board, else you haven't understood it enough.
- Clients will appreciate you more if you can explain a technological challenge / problem and its implication on business. But don't try to mingle your words or use heavy jargons to avoid questions or create beautiful presentations for explaining it. That's all unnecessary fluff. Don't underestimate intellects of your client. 
- Nobody hates genuine questions. Questioning is also form of probing to see how much passion does other person have for her / his thoughts ? Always start with 'Why' !
- Never say it can't be done or there's no solution. There's always a way. Sometimes, it takes longer than a while to figure it out. Or it takes more efforts.
- Everything is interesting if you go deep into it.

### Career / life lessons:
- You don't get to learn everything on project. Don't wait for that 'right' project to give you an opportunity to learn. Invest time and efforts to learn on your own.
- Don't always ask "What my organization can do for me, ask yourself what I can do for my organization" ?
- Mentoring someone and seeing one's growth is amazing feeling. If you can, you should. For that you don't need to be official mentor / buddy / guide etc.
- If you really care about someone's growth, don't sugar coat your words. It will put them in illusion. Having healthy environment of giving strong and genuine feedback helps everyone in the long run. At the end of the day, it's not about 'you' or 'me' who are working on a project but the ultimate value that 'we' want to deliver to customers.
- Have strong but loosely held opinions. With this mindset, you will be proven wrong by either your own mistakes or by someone around you who can come up with logically sound and convincing reasoning. This will help you learn. If you don't have opinions, then you don't have motivations to do or to try anything, if you don't try anything then you will not make mistakes and you will never learn.
- There's space for everyone in any field you work in. Be yourself. The moment you start imitating someone, you have lost your uniqueness.
- Always ask yourself, Am I adding any value or has it become 'same s**t, another day', if it has already been like that, then go fix it.
- Find yourself a larger purpose than money to come to work everyday. This will help you enjoy your lifetime in any role that you are in. Otherwise, you will always be void and empty.
- Great culture is not just greeting your teammates every morning or celebrating their birthdays together. It's also not about having free meals or some extra perks that we all get at our respective organizations. It's about being responsible for your actions. Being accountable for your suggestions and taking ownership of your work. Find a place with this sort of culture that will give you an opportunity to build these qualities. If you happen to find one then don't waste that opportunity.

That's it. More or less these are going to be guiding principles for my future journey in the world of software industry. Thanks.
